# ⚠️ Support for the Thu-Khoa-Ly Project has ended

After February 19, 2025, we will no longer provide security updates or technical support for the **Thu-Khoa-Ly Project**.

## Info
This is my 4th project in the **Crazy Gifts** series, and this time, we are proud to introduce the **Thu-Khoa-Ly Project**.

There is no fixed deadline for this project. However, we typically conclude a project within 1 to 2 years, with a minimum duration of 6 months. Some projects deemed unsuitable or harmful are immediately canceled and removed.
